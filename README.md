# RollBuddy
**Roll Buddy is a virtual Dungeons and Dragons character sheet service that does most of the management associated with a pen-and-paper character sheet for you. It allows users to enter in all the important information such as character stats, skills, and gear and then calculates the roll modifiers and bonuses that are used for various actions in the game. It also allows users to roll various dice in the app so that they do not need to bring physical dice in order to play.**

## Repository Layout
The service is split into 2 systems:

### Frontend
This is where the user facing code will be held:
- What the user will interact with
- How it is presented to them 

### Backend
This is code involving information and systems not directly shown to the user:

- User Account System
- Campaign Ruleset System
