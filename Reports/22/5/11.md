# Dumb & Developers Rollbuddy Status Report (5/11/2022)

## Team Report

### Last Week Goals:

- Finalize DB Schema and begin a base connection 
- Begin connecting Frontend to backend structures 
- Continue implementing react components and UI assets 

### Work Done:
- React components and UI assets are implemented with interactive functionality 
- The frontend and backend is connected through Spark locally 
- Database schema completed

### Next Week Goals:

- Finish implementation of the rest components of the frontend
- Optimize the code for connecting backend and frontend, and look up and tried to hosting backend on server
- Make the UI more appealing
- Improve testing and pipeline

## Individual Contributions:

 ### Last Week Goals:
- **Tyler**: Continuing implementation from last week--character sheet components and state are the only focus.
- **Esau**: Working on the implementation of the Character session module, Hoping to get a working local MVP of the product by next week
- **Arpan**: Finalize the database schema and start connecting the backend to the DB (figure out where to host, how to connect, etc.)
- **Jun**: A code session with Tyler, break down the page into smaller components, also implement interactive components, and integrate with the current page
- **Jacob**: Start using the character session/character sheet classes to start assigning them from URL and possibly try to get this working with multiple sessions but focusing on just one for now.
- **Thomas**: Implement some React components for different sections of our UI


### Work Done:
- **Tyler**: Major frontend work was completed (both layout and functionality) this week in addition to a new gradle task to run the backend without needing to open an IDE.
- **Esau**: 
- **Arpan**: Backend has been completed in terms of structures for the most part with only minor changes needed. The same can be said for the DB schema
- **Jun**: Assist Tyler with few button functionality. After the product was ready for demo, looked up some styling for the button and input box. Tried integrating over with our set up and implementing it, but did not succeed.  
- **Jacob**: Created the backend server to handle creating, updating and returning character data when requested from the front end.
- **Thomas**: Implemented the UI for the character status bar and the roll menu window. Additionally, implemented the ability for the character status component and roll menu to save user inputted data locally. Revised the ability component to improve clarity. 



### Next Week Goal:
- **Tyler**: write more frontend tests and work on fetching more data from the backend to minimize the use of local browser storage. Additionally, create more documentation for the frontend.
- **Esau**: 
- **Arpan**: Need to create the JUnit tests and start connecting backend DB 
- **Jun**: Looked up more styling templated and information, tried to implement and make the current component more appling
- **Jacob**: Look into hosting the backend server and clean up the code for Session.java
- **Thomas**: Implementing the UI and frontend skeleton for remaining components in our draft like the tabs window and the miscellaneous window.
